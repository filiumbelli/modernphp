  4. Linode is an option.
- Dedicated Server
  1. Fast and real machines
  2. Sssh available

  4. It can be managed and unmanaged
- PaaS(Platform as a Service)
  1. It doesn't need to be managed
  2. AWS GOOGLE HEROKU are examples of this type
  3. Recommended for developers who dont want to manage their own servers.

# Choose a Hosting Plan
- Choose only what you need when you need it. You can always scale your hosting
infrastructure up or down when necessary. 
- For small PHP applications or prototypes, a
PaaS provider like Engine Yard or Heroku is the best and quickest solution. If you prefer
more control over your server configuration, get a VPS. If your application becomes
super-popular and your VPS is buckling beneath the weight of millions of visitors
(congratulations, by the way!), get a dedicated server. Whichever hosting option you
choose, make sure it provides the latest stable PHP version and extensions required by
your PHP application.
